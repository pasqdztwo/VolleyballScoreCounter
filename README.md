# VolleyballScoreCounter
A volleyball score counter app created for the Google Developers Challenge: Android Basics course.

Add points by choosing how they were scored - the points will be added to the overall score as well as to the detailed stats. 
Once a set is finished send the set results by e-mail and reset the score.

At the moment the number of sets won is not stored between sets (has to be added manually after each set).
